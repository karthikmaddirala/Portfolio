                "Worked on developing predictive models to forecast pavement distress on highways using real-time visual data. Leveraged camera systems to capture road surface conditions and applied machine learning techniques to analyze cracks, potholes, and other signs of degradation.​",
                "Combined visual analysis with contextual data such as traffic load and environmental factors to improve prediction accuracy. The goal was to enable early detection of distress and support proactive maintenance strategies, contributing to safer and more cost-effective infrastructure management."
