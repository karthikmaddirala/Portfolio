        "description": "This project presents an end-to-end retail analytics pipeline that simulates a Point of Sale (POS) data flow. It leverages Amazon S3 for data storage, Snowflake for warehousing and semantic modeling, and Power BI for real-time dashboarding. The goal is to deliver business insights from structured sales and customer data.  I modeled the schema in Snowflake using a star schema, and built a semantic layer using SQL views and Power BI relationships to define KPIs, hierarchies, and drill-down paths for analysis.",
        "description2":"Designed and published 3 dynamic Power BI dashboards, enabling data-driven decisions across 50+ store locations. Authored 4 professional-grade reports and delivered schema documentation, ensuring technical clarity, stakeholder alignment, and auditability for BI/analytics teams.",

It involves comprehensive data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and visualization to extract meaningful patterns. Key steps include handling missing data, outlier removal, feature engineering, and transformation. Multiple regression models were trained and evaluated, with CatBoost achieving over 90% accuracy, making the system reliable for real estate insights and price forecasting.",
